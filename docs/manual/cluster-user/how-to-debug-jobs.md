# How to Debug Jobs

This document describes how to use SSH and TensorBoard plugin to debug job. 

**Note:** These two plugins only work when the IP address is accessible from customer environment (not cluster internal IP). So if PAI deployed in some cloud environment such as Azure, these two plugins will not work.

## How to use SSH

OpenPAI provides SSH plugin for you to connect to job containers. To use SSH, you can either create an SSH key pair, or use your own pre-generated keys.

**Option 1. Create an SSH Key Pair**

It is feasible to create a new SSH key pair when you submit the job. First, open the `Tools` panel, enable the SSH plugin, then click `SSH Key Generator`:

The generator will generate one public key and one private key for you. Please download SSH private key, then click `Use Public Key` button to use this key pair in your job.

After job submission, you can ssh to job containers as user root with the downloaded private key through container ip and ssh port. The `View SSH Info` button will give you the corresponding command:

To be detailed, you should refer to the `Use a pre-downloaded SSH private key` section. If you are using Windows, the following command is for you:

```bash
ssh -p <ssh-port> -i <your-private-key-file-path> root@<container-ip>
```

On a Unix-like system, the command is:

```bash
chmod 400 <your-private-key-file-path> && ssh -p <ssh-port> -i <your-private-key-file-path> <container-ip>
```

**Option 2. Use your Own Keys**

If you are familiar with SSH key authentication, you would probably have generated a public key and a private key already, in the folder `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\.ssh` (it is `~/.ssh/` on a Unix-like system). There is an `id_rsa.pub` file and an `id_rsa` file in such folder, which are the public key and the private key, respectively. 

To use them, open the `id_rsa.pub` and copy its content to the SSH plugin, then submit the job. Do not use the key generator.

After submission, you can use `ssh -p <ssh-port> root@<container-ip>` to connect to the job container, directly.

## How to use TensorBoard Plugin

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding your TensorFlow runs and graphs.

Here we leverage an example to show you how to use TensorBoard in OpenPAI. First, open the job submission page, input the following commands in the `Command` box:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/pai.git
cd pai
git reset --hard dd08930431d05ed490cf7ceeecd262e473c187cd
cd docs/user/samples/
python minist_tensorboard.py --data_dir ./data --log_dir /mnt/tensorboard
sleep 30m
```

Then, please select `TensorFlow 1.15.0 + Python 3.6 with GPU, CUDA 10.0` as your docker image. Last but not least, toggle the `Enable TensorBoard` button in the `Tools` section.

After submission, you will see a `Go to TensorBoard Page` button on the job detail page.

   <img src="./imgs/go-to-tensorboard-page.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

The button will bring you to the TensorBoard page. You might wait a few minutes until the log is ready:

Generally speaking, to use the TensorBoard plugin, you should:

  1. Save your TensorFlow summary logs to `/mnt/tensorboard`
  2. Make sure `tensorboard` is installed in the docker image you use.
  3. Use the `sleep` command to extend the job lifetime, if you want TensorBoard available after job completes.
