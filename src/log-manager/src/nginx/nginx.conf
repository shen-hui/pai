# nginx.conf  --  docker-openresty
#
# This file is installed to:
#   `/usr/local/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`
# and is the file loaded by nginx at startup,
# unless the user specifies otherwise.
#
# It tracks the upstream OpenResty's `nginx.conf`, but removes the `server`
# section and adds this directive:
#     `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;`
#
# The `docker-openresty` file `nginx.vh.default.conf` is copied to
# `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.  It contains the `server section
# of the upstream `nginx.conf`.
#
# See https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/blob/master/README.md#nginx-config-files
