# This script parse the result of "docker system df" command to get the total reclaimable disk space.
# This command will list the reclaimable space of all docker objects including images, local volumes and build caches.
# Following is a example of the command's output:
# TYPE                TOTAL               ACTIVE              SIZE                RECLAIMABLE
# Images              38                  18                  16.13GB             11.26GB (69%)
# Containers          42                  42                  95.3MB              0B (0%)
# Local Volumes       13                  1                   3.553GB             3.28GB (92%)

# We summer up the result in column 5 (RECLAIMABLE) and return the size in gigabytes.
