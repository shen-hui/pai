# Examples for OpenPAI (500Task)
Here we provide a CPU-only job with 500 tasks on a taskrole. The example use ConvNet model on the MNIST task. We look for the optimal learning rate in the range from 0.0001 to 0.9981(Take 500 values at equal intervals). 

## Experiment Results
| Network | Hardware | Time |GPU & CPU Utilization | Accuracy (Some Examples) | Yaml Example|
| :----:| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| ConvNet | CPU | 6h30m10s (500*5 epoch) | [Details](metrics/ConvNet_CPU_500Task.JPG) | 95.15% (lr: 0.0101)  98.53% (lr: 0.1001)  98.95% (lr: 0.9981)| [CPU_500Task_MNIST.yaml](yaml/CPU_500Task_MNIST.yaml) |

## Usage
Before running this example, you should first make sure that you have at least one permitted storage in OpenPAI. If you donâ€™t know how to use storage, please refer to [our doc](https://openpai.readthedocs.io/).

Before submitting yaml file as mentioned above (in the yaml folder), you need to update the following commands with your own storage path:

`master` taskrole:
```
python get_results.py --number=500 --data_path /mnt/confignfs/mnist500_result/
-->
python get_results.py --number=500 --data_path <your own storage path>/mnist500_result/
```

`taskrole` taskerole:
```
mount -t nfs4 10.151.40.235:/data data
-->
mount -t nfs4 <NFS_SERVER:/NFS_PATH> data
```

Now you can submit the yaml file to try this example, and **don't forget** to select the storage you want to use in the `data` area on the right side of the page. 

## Visualization of results

When all instances in `taskrole` run successfully, you can view the visualized results through the running `master`. The following figure shows the final status of the successful job. It should be noted that the visualized results can only be viewed when the `master` is running. This taskrole will keep running until the user manually stops it.

You can access jupyter notebook by visiting `<master_IP>:8888` in the browser. Then, click on the file `show_results.ipynb`.
